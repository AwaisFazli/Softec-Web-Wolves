          "A spectacular village, known as Art and craft village, Shakarparian, was established in Islamabad, Pakistan. The village is a Potohari Organization formed by the natives in cooperation with Pakistan’s Capital Development Authority (CDA) to amplify the inter-provincial harmony. Previously it was a small village, and a few Ghakkar families resided here, but now they have settled in different parts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. However, the purpose of the village is to bring the craftsman from other areas of Pakistan to one place. Therefore, this village brings the artist from Tharparkar to Chitral and from Kashmir to Kashmoor all at one place throughout the year to display the indigenous arts and handicrafts. Moreover, it also serves as the central place for the South Asian Region to conduct cultural activities.",

          "The eye-popping Shah Faisal Mosque, nestled at the foot of the Margalla Hills, Islamabad, is one of Asia’s largest mosques, reflecting an eclectic blend of ultramodern and traditional architectural design styles. The whole structure covers an area of 33 acres which dominates the landscape of Islamabad in beautiful Pakistan, a significant attraction for visitors. It was the largest Mosque in the world until 1993, when the mosques in Saudi Arabia overtook it. However, Faisal Mosque is now the sixth-largest Mosque in the world in terms of capacity. Moreover, The International Islamic University used to be housed on the Mosque grounds and prayer, but it moved to a new campus in 2000. Also, the mausoleum of the late President, Zia-ul-Haq, is adjacent to the Mosque. About 300,000 worshippers can accommodate in Faisal Mosque at a time. The mosque’s four minarets are 79 meters (259 feet) tall and 1010 meters in diameter (the tallest minarets in South Asia). Inside, the air hums with muffled recitations. The mosque has an eight-sided concrete shell with a contemporary style influenced by a Bedouin tent. The Mosque’s geometric design and clean lines make the impressive scale hard to discern until you are up close. In the designer’s imagination, the Shah Faisal Mosque resembles the Holy Kaaba. In a strictly abstract way, he attempted to capture the essence, proportion, and geometry of the Kaaba. Instead of using traditional domes, Vedat Dalokay built an eight-sided main hall that resembled a Bedouin’s desert tent from the Arab world. He also built four 80 m (260 ft) tall minarets on all four corners of the main hall, making them the most towering minarets in South Asia. The main prayer hall, supported by four concrete girders, is the building’s main structure. In addition, Turkish architecture influenced the four peculiar minarets. The prayer hall is approached from the east via a courtyard with entrances.",
        history:
          "During an official visit to Pakistan in 1966, King Faisal-Bin-Abdul-Aziz sponsored the Pakistani government to establish a National Mosque in Islamabad. In 1969, an international competition was held in which architects from 17 different countries submitted 43 designs. The winning design was by a Turkish architect, Vedat Dalokay. The land of the mosques has 46 acres, and they gave the execution to a Pakistani engineer and staff. The Mosque was built in 1976 after a $28 million grant from Saudi King Faisal, whose Mosque’s name bears. After his assassination in 1975, King Faisal-Bin-Abdul Aziz helped raise funds for the Mosque, and both the Mosque and the road leading to it were named after him. Shah Khalid, the successor of King Faisal-Bin-Abdul-Aziz, laid the foundation stone for the Mosque in October 1976 and signed the building contract in 1978. However, the Mosque was completed in 1986, the first prayer offered on June 18, 1988.",

That was the situation for centuries. There were three groups of Paharia primitive tribes, namely the Sauria Paharias, Kumarbhag Paharias, and the Mal Paharias. They had been living in the Rajmahal Hills, since when it is difficult to trace. They lived mostly in hill tracts. Prior to the arrival of the British, the Paharias led a life undisturbed by the mighty empires reigning in the region. That was mostly the result of their geographical isolation. The Mughals never seem to have conquered the area, possibly because they failed to penetrate into the deeply forested hilly tracts. They were hill-locked and completely isolated from the outside world. They were also never in any way subordinate to the British Raj till around the end of eighteenth century.",

This place located in the district of Larkana in Southern Sindh of Pakistan, was revealed in the 1920s. This archaeological site gained significance in 1922 when minings uncovered that the mounds have remnants of the Indus Valley Civilization’s largest city. The size of the city is about 3 miles (5 kilometers). The city has a rich heritage wrapped in monuments and other buildings. Mohenjo Daro got the honor of being labeled as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1980. ",
        history:
          "Mohenjo Daro’s history is as old as 4,600 years ago. It was built around 2600 BCE on the Indus River’s west side with around 35,000 to 50,000 people living in it. It is considered to be one of the oldest cities in the world and the earliest from the Indus Valley Civilization’s culture of the Bronze Age. However, people left this city in 1900 BCE and the logic behind it is vague. The exact reasons for its decline remain a mystery. Mohenjo Daro was hidden under layers of dirt and soil for thousands of years until it was found in 1922 by R. D. Banerji, who worked for the Archaeological Survey of India. During the 1930s, many people, like John Marshall, K. N. Dikshit, and Ernest Mackay, led big minings at Mohenjo Daro.  The last time people did a major excavation at Mohenjo-daro was in 1964-65, led by Dr. G. F. Dales. But after 1965, they stopped digging more because they were prohibited from doing so as it might jeopardize the old ruins. It turns out that only a part of the site, about one-third, has been uncovered until now. Some experts think we’ve only found 10 to 20 percent of what’s really there. The place is in danger because of erosion, which is when wind and water slowly wear away the ancient structures. Even though the Pakistani government and UNESCO have tried to protect it, it’s still at risk. Archaeologists from Pakistan made a statement in 2012 that unless there’s a big effort to save it, Mohenjo Daro might vanish by 2030.",

Then, in 1949, they started a fund called the Quaid-e-Azam Memorial Fund (QMF) to make a proper memorial site. They were indecisive in selecting a particular design idea. Architects across the globe were asked to share their designs. A British architect won the competition, but Jinnah’s sister, Fatima Jinnah, didn’t like it, so its usage was declined. Fatima Jinnah took charge of the QMF and asked an Indian architect named Yahya Merchant to design her brother’s monument. They began building it in 1960, and President Ayub Khan laid the first stone.

The Mohra Muradu monastery is situated between Sirkap and Julian in Taxila. The word Mohra translated into English means ‘Pawn’. The Monastery was discovered in the early twentieth century during digging superintended by famous archaeologist Sir John Marshal. The Kashans built the Monastery and stupa, which were later restored in the third and fourth centuries. The Monastery is designed around a courtyard with a pool and has 27 rooms for students and professors. Like those found in other Gandhara monasteries, a vast water pond can be discovered here, which, according to archaeologists, met drinking water requirements and was used by monks to cultivate lotus flowers. The pool was built in a square shape, was about half a meter deep, and held water. This pool utilizes for ceremonial bathing for the students and instructors who live here and the locals.",
